          Welcome to my website! My name is Thomas Walsh, and Iâ€™m a computer
          science student at UMass Amherst as a member of the class of 2027. I
          have been interested in computer science and programming since I was
          little, as my first experience programming was developing video games.
          My current goal is to become a software or web developer with the
          skills to create easy-to-use applications accessible to everyone.

        <span className='about-body' style={{ marginBottom: "3rem"}}>
          As a continuous learner, I have picked up many skills in software and web development.
          Here are some of the well-known libraries and tools I have used when creating applications.
